This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Fixed a minor dplyr vs. plyr bug in help file examples by prefacing (dplyr::mutate)
- Made minor function efficiency improvements

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.3.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.3
* Windows (on apveyor)
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
